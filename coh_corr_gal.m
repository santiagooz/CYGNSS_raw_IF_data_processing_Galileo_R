function [ y ] = coh_corr_gal( S, fs, c, fD, tau, Ti, delay_initial)
% coh_corr_gal calculates the correlation between the signal S
% and a local Galileo E1b replica for every delay and Doppler
% value defined in tau and fD. It is expected that the coherent integration
% time is an integer multiple of 1 ms.

% If S is a matrix, their columns are treated as separate segments of the
% signal. The output y is a three-dimensional matrix representing a
% coherent correlation plane for each signal segment.

K = size(S,2);      % number of signal segments
fc = 1.023e6;       % C/A code chip frequency [Hz]

Lf = size(fD,1);    % number of Doppler bins
Lt = length(tau);   % number of delay bins
y = zeros(Lt,K,Lf); % coherent correlation results

N = floor(Ti*fs);
x0 = S;
n = 0 : N-1;
t = n'/fs;
os = 0;

% The coherent correlations are calculated as the IFFT of the product of
% their FFTs. Only the FFT of the Doppler shifted signal is calculated for
% every bin. The FFT of local replica with the corrseponding delay shift
% for every signal segment can be calculated outside of the loop that 
% iterates through the Doppler bins.
